- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBioCoder
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine learning algorythms, Bioinformatics Projects, computer vision and cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more in depth Python scripting to create much more efficient algrorythms for more advanced
bioinformatics projects. I want to build an AI engine for the analysis of physical traits and genetic vulnerabilities in
complex family and population group datasets
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my current project which I've been working on since 04/06/2021
- 📫 How to reach me ...
